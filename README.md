# blog
Hello! Welcome to an attempt at a blog! I decided to just use plain old github so I could experiment with a "blog as code." There's a variety of reasons for this including

1) I'm planning on writing a lot of code and I wan't the code to always be compilable.
2) I plan on updating posts and code continuously
3) I like the idea of version control being available for these posts
4) I suspect that these posts (and the resulting code) will be highly referential, so colocating everything could turn out well.

Feel free to contribute PRs against the blog if you see any issues or have any suggestions, or create a github issue to start a discussion!
