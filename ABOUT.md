# About this blog

## Why
I'm starting this blog to

1) Force myself to organize my thoughts and opinions and hopefully refine them
2) "Learn in public"
3) Provide a better reflection of me as an engineer for future potential employers. Ideally, recruiters can filter me out of the pipeline sooner after skimming some of my writing.

## Why Github?
I think one of the few things I can contribute is full working code examples. Most blog posts have great snippets of code, but there is a lack of larger runnable examples. Additionally, I've been burned by code examples that had unseen dependencies. Now, at least for my larger examples, you can see exactly the context the code lives in.

I also like the idea of easily including example PRs against the existing code to show how easy something is or is not to refactor.

I'm also of the belief that a lot of engineering knowledge has a relationship closer to a graph than a linear path, which is why I'm adopting a "pattern language" approach, where blog posts are different entry points to an ever growing collection of patterns that represent my engineering-weltanschauung.

As a result, I expect the write-ups here will be highly referential to each other so there will be a ton of hyperlinks. I'm imagining something like [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org/) but somehow even nerdier.

So because I want tons of code examples and tons of linked pages/resources I felt just putting the whole thing in github as a bunch of markdown files might work out. If not, I'll convert it to a NextJs app.

## Anything else?
This blog is likely to end up as a thin wrapper around [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8QG9I1XW0) and an assortment of Uncle Bob blog posts, but with more Kotlin (with Arrow) and Haskell.
