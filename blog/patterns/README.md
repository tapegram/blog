# Patterns
This directory should contain a "wiki" of related patterns referenced by blog posts.

I'm envisioning that as posts are added, we build up a list of patterns that others can steal, dispute, update, etc. representing my understanding of software engineering.

See the [template](template.md) in this directory for an explanation of the format of these patterns.
