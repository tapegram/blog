# Architecture Patterns at Extend

Over the last year at Extend, we have been working on standardizing some architecture patterns to help us scale the platform and the team. These patterns are heavily based on ports and adapters, domain driven design, and FP principles.

The major goal of identifying and "standardizing" these patterns is to make it easy to ramp up and be productive in them -- without necessarily reading a pile of books about capital-A-Architecture. To accomplish this, we wanted to balance a few opposing qualities:

1. loose coupling vs cognitive overhead
2. gentle learning curve vs "advanced" patterns
3. templates and guardrails vs flexibility and experimentation

Basically, we want it to be standardized enough that you can just apply what you see in the code around you, and you should be able to look at different areas of the codebase and have a good sense of how it works and where different changes should be made -- but not so aggressively standardized that you can't experiment or iterate on the patterns to improve them over time.

This presentation was made for the Chicago Kotlin User Group a couple months ago and has continued to be used as a resource to help new engineers onboard. Even in the last couple months there have been some improvements and variations to the architecture, which I think is a testament to it's adaptability. We have also had several other teams start applying these patterns, and though it is still early, the signs are positive!

Unfortunately, the talk was not recorded. But the slides have all of the speaker notes included, which I read verbatum, so you are getting the benefit of both worlds: all of the context + none of hearing my voice.
