# On Retros

## Intro
I can't think of a more pretentious name for a blog post than this. It's honestly kind of embarassing. Actually, writing any thoughts online is embarassing but it's a helpful exercise (I hope!).

Anyway, this is another opinion and personal experience heavy post about one of my favorite topics: Sprint Retrospectives. The longer I operate as a self-styled "software engineer," the more and more I am convinced that the structure and processes of an organization and the teams that write the software are inextricably tied to the resulting code and success of the product. There is a long-winded and rambling talk I've given attempting to appraise this at a high level [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEGIfvxK8Uo) in case you have entirely too much free time. 

That being said, if I can convince you of nothing else over this post, I'd like to convince you that retros are the best tool to improve your team's process and structure in an agile, incremental, bottom-up way -- and as a result, improving the quality and quantity of your code and delivering more value for your organization.

I'm also pretty well convinced that the best way to deliver better value for your organization is to "grow" your engineers (from juniors to seniors) and your teams (from a collection of engineers to a real, stable, [TEAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFGD5pj03M&ab_channel=Channel4)).

This post takes these ideas/values as a given. If you want to hear more here are some resources I would recommend:

I also want to mention that teams (like individuals) need to build competency in nearly everything they do. Newer or more unstable teams, regardless of the individual talent they have, will not always succeed in applying good ideas / processes / patterns. Part of retros is focused on building competencies with processes as crutches, until the process is no longer needed and doing away with it. My fencing coach once told me:
> If you are losing it is because you can't tell what the opponent is doing, 
> 
> or you know what they are doing but you don't know what to do about it
> 
> or you know what they are doing and you know what to do about it, but your don't have the technical ability to execute on it.

This is the exact kind of "Art of War" wisdom that I love because in some ways it's like "well, duh" but also I find the ideal so well articulated that I keep coming back to it and applying it as a problem-solving framework.

In software terms this might be
1) Have you identified the REAL problem?
2) Have you identified the REAL solution (or at least a good solution)?
3) Have you actually executed the solution well?

Any of these can fail, and its crucial to be able to identify what step you are failing on. Too often I see teams do 1 & 2 correctly, but lack the experience as a team to execute on the solution. They then abandon the solution entirely instead of working to build the competency needed to execute it.

Being at least "pretty good" at this kind of problem-solving is essential to running successful retros.

Here is a rough outline of what I'd like to cover:
1) Why retros are so important
2) What makes a retro "good" and what makes one "bad"
3) How do you make a "bad" retro and make it "good?"
4) Some success stories
5) A collection of common problems I've seen teams encounter and some possible retro driven solutions (read: patterns!).

And finally, as a massive disclaimer, these are all ideas and recommendations from my own personal experience. What works for me may not work for you. I'm certain that in another year/month/tomorrow, I will learn something new and change all my recommendations here. Feel free to take and try anything you like but just remember that there is no "one true way" and agile/retros are all about learning and trying new things.
